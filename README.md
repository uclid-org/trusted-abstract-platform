# trusted-abstract-platform

## Requirements
The models and proofs in this repository requires (UCLID5)[https://github.com/uclid-org/uclid] to build and run.
They can either be run directly or via the Makefiles found in the subdirectories.

## Directory Structure
- `Common/` contains common UCLID5 code across the models and proofs
- `TrustedAbstractPlatform/modules` contains the TAP models
- `TrustedAbstractPlatform/proofs` contains the proofs of Secure Remote Execution
